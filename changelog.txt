Changelog TemporalGraphVisualization

=== 2020-11-30 ===
= Features =

 - Coloured bezier now uses multiple continuous curves instead of segments

 - possibility to show certain statistics of the drawn graph

= Bugfixes =

 - Fixed bug where fade-out caused colors to flip

=== 2020-11-16 ===
= Features =

 - Coloured bezier detail now dependent on curviness (reduces file size and visual artifacts)

 - Function to see the average number of neighbours per cluster in TimeGraph

 - Debug mode switch and code to print debug info in SVG

= Bugfixes =

 - Bezier derivative not stable at exactly 0 or 1, so now has a small offset

 - Fixed bug where cluster would get the wrong rank if it had no connections on one side (this fixed a LOT of issues)

 - Fixed bug where amount of alignment crossings were not computed correctly

= Documentation =

 - Made upper and lower order in function definitions consistent (but these terms should still be renamed because confusing)



=== 2020-11-11 ===
= Features =

 - initial ordering is now based on 'supercluster'

 - improved barycenter ordering when a cluster did not have incoming or have outgoing connections

 - Added drawing_utils, which provides a multicoloured bezier function (dramatically increases file size, however)

 - Added fading options to the multicoloured bezier and as option for the graph

= Bugfixes =

 - Several bugs in the anti-staircase mechanism were ironed out

= Documentation =

 - Added: sort_by_supercluster
