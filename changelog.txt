Changelog TemporalGraphVisualization

=== 2021-02-11 ===
= Features =

 - Added total graph crossing count

 - Added some chain (community) statistics

 - Changed the chain break condition. If a connection is smaller than the cluster size it connects to times
     a parameter (default 0.4) it cannot align the two clusters. Replaces the maximum in/out difference.

 - Added the emphasize_communities flag to draw_graph(), which will darken connections that are not part of a chain.

= Documentation =

 - Documentation updated and added for changes made in last update.

=== 2021-01-13 ===
= Features =

 - Added data_importer.py for easily importing data

 - Timegraph now accepts more forms of input for nodes and conns and has more defaults

 - Split out add_missing to separate function

=== 2021-01-11 ===
= Bugfixes =

 - Removed RecordingSurface from code due to bugged behaviour

=== 2020-12-15 ===
= Features =

 - updated stat_plotter.py

 - Restuctured folder structure to reduce clutter

= Documentation =

 - Renamed Sugiyama things to SizedConnection things

 - Regenerated documentation

=== 2020-12-14 ===
= Features =

 - Added a statistics plotter and various statistics

=== 2020-12-03 ===
= Documentation =

 - Finished almost all documentation in layout.py

 - Generated html documentation in html/

=== 2020-12-02 ===
= Features =

 - Moved the minimum cluster and connection filtering to TimeGraph class

 - Moved certain statistics to TimeGraph, because they do not depend on the drawing

 - Moved scale parameter to draw_graph

 - Reduced unnecessary output

= Documentation =

 - Added missing documentation to all SugiyamaCluster methods

 - Added missing documentation to building and ordering sections of the SugiyamaLayout class

=== 2020-11-30 ===
= Features =

 - Coloured bezier now uses multiple continuous curves instead of segments

 - possibility to show certain statistics of the drawn graph

= Bugfixes =

 - Fixed bug where fade-out caused colors to flip

= Other =

 - Identified bug in cairo library (currently there exists an unmerged fix)

=== 2020-11-16 ===
= Features =

 - Coloured bezier detail now dependent on curviness (reduces file size and visual artifacts)

 - Function to see the average number of neighbours per cluster in TimeGraph

 - Debug mode switch and code to print debug info in SVG

= Bugfixes =

 - Bezier derivative not stable at exactly 0 or 1, so now has a small offset

 - Fixed bug where cluster would get the wrong rank if it had no connections on one side (this fixed a LOT of issues)

 - Fixed bug where amount of alignment crossings were not computed correctly

= Documentation =

 - Made upper and lower order in function definitions consistent (but these terms should still be renamed because confusing)



=== 2020-11-11 ===
= Features =

 - initial ordering is now based on 'supercluster'

 - improved barycenter ordering when a cluster did not have incoming or have outgoing connections

 - Added drawing_utils, which provides a multicoloured bezier function (dramatically increases file size, however)

 - Added fading options to the multicoloured bezier and as option for the graph

= Bugfixes =

 - Several bugs in the anti-staircase mechanism were ironed out

= Documentation =

 - Added: sort_by_supercluster
