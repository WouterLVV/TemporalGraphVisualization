(Legend: ++ done, -- to do, >> to revisit / something is in limbo because of the merge)

Bugs

++ fix overlap at meeting
++ tighten SVGSurface (left/right margins)
>> xseparation is best fixed to points rather than automated from max_bundle
>> bottom margin also left to user
++ font size: from user, or pegged to the fixed xseparation
++ colours automatic from a palette
++ draw each cluster centered on its row (rather than top-aligned)
++ layout suboptimal vertically
++ draw a bundle incoming into root clusters
++ Drawing artifacts on wide lines (because it is secretly going backwards first and then forwards, probably)
++ In TimeGraph: the clusters/bundles below min_cluster_size to be removed from the TimeGraph as early as possible

Method

>> automated cluster height
++ automated ymargin
>> automated xseparation (undone though, best left controllable)
++ automated yseparation
++ start/end timestamp for separate block plotting
++ move user parameters to initialisation: font_size, xseparation, etc.
>> xmargin = font_size

++ aggregate time as unconditional union of contacts (weak aggregation)
++ aggregate time only over significant, reoccurring links (strong aggregation)
-- aggregate time to variable periods (GMM as in 15-BES-Psorakis)
++ respect absolute time, all sensed time blocks shown
++ annotate time on the x axis
>> annotate bundle sizes (at changepoints)
-- skip drawing the cluster (vertical bars) when community stable (remains the same); it's superfluous and clogs the picture

++ metadata as colour

-- informative statistic for the visualisation: length of stable comm., density
-- emphasise stable communities on the plot
-- automatically set parameters (strength, new_period, minimum_connections_size) to discover communities
      plot informative statistic vs. parameters (multi-objective), then optimise
      fitness: max. difference to null model (15-BES-Psorakis)
      add boostrapping (repetition, looking for stability)
-- map community events (merge, split) to story events; have the narrative write itself
   evaluate it with synthetic data w. ground truth!

Network types

++ visualise (largely) contiguous, fine-grained proximity data (human, animal contact)
   RFID contacts encode space-time contiguous locations (visualised knowing the time, not the space interval)
++ visualise sparse tempnets/contact sequences, e.g. emails, messages, bill sponsorship (regularised w. time aggregation)
-- visualise hypergraphs (straightforward)
-- visualise tempnets with edge duration/interval graphs, e.g. calls, badgers (straightforward)
-- visualise bipartite networks, e.g. bee-flower
-- visualise infection dynamics (SIR; follow all individuals)
