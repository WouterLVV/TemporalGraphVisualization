Bugs

++ fix overlap at meeting
++ tighten SVGSurface
++ fixed font size for fixed bottom margin
-- xseparation is best fixed to points rather than automated from data (max_bundle)
-- some undrawn contacts seem to spoil the layout?
-- layout suboptimal; don't know why so much empty space (vertical and at left/right margins)
-- better estimate bottom margin

Method

++ automated cluster height
++ automated ymargin
++ automated xseparation
++ automated yseparation
++ start/end timestamp for separate block plotting
++ move user parameters to initialisation

++ aggregate time as unconditional union of contacts (weak aggregation)
++ aggregate time only over significant, reoccurring links (strong aggregation)
++ respect absolute time, all sensed time blocks shown
++ annotate time on the x axis

++ metadata as colour

-- annotate bundle sizes (one per community)
-- complexity metric: temporal motifs (split+merge, stable comm.)
-- emphasise stable communities on the plot, without adding visual overhead
-- automatically set parameters (strength, new_period, minimum_connections_size) to discover communities
      plot complexity metric vs. parameters (multi-objective), then choose

Network types

++ visualise (largely) contiguous, fine-grained proximity data (human, animal contact)
   RFID contacts encode space-time contiguous locations (visualised knowing the time, not the space interval)
-- visualise tempnets with edge duration, e.g. calls, badgers (straightforward)
-- visualise sparse tempnets, e.g. smses
-- visualise infection dynamics (SIR; follow all individuals)
-- visualise bipartite networks, e.g. bee-flower

Comparison

++ sequence view
++ node order: recurrent neighbours RN (Linhares 2017)
-- node order: community-based node ordering CNO (Linhares 2019)
-- temporal activity map
-- list of adjacency matrices (clustered)

Evaluation

-- stability: aggregated plot changes slightly when changing the start timestamp
   (check if stabilised with strong aggregation)
-- aesthetic metrics
   #line crossings
   line wiggling
   space efficiency
-- scalability metrics
   #time frames
   #agents
-- community-detection metrics (tbd)
   bundle crossings
